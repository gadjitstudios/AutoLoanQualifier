Steps to RUN or BUILD
1. Clone the project from this Git Repository
2. open a terminal in the project's root directory
3. In the terminal run 
    npm i 
to pull in all of the dependencies.
4. After the dependencies have been install, you can run the project by entering:
    npm start
in the terminal (again you must be in the project's root directory); or, you can build the project by entering:
    npm run-script build
in the terminal.
